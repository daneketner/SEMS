function [N P] = search_sst(t,sst)

%SEARCH_SST: Function accepts a reference datenum t and a nx2 array of
%  datenum Start/Stop Times. The SST element containing time t, or the
%  SST element preceding t will be returned in output N, with output P
%  indicating whether the t is inside of sst(N,:), or between sst(N-1,2)
%  and sst(N,1). This function can be used to find a sst element, or locate
%  a place between elements to place a new sst element.
%
%USAGE: [N P] = search_sst(t,sst)
%
%INPUTS: t --> reference time (datenum) to be located
%        sst --> nx2 Start/Stop Time (datenum) array to search in  
%
%OUTPUTS: N --> if P==1, t is inside sst(N,:)
%               if P==0, t is between sst(N-1,2) and sst(N,1)
%         P --> Indicates whether t is inside of, or before sst(N,:)
%               1 --> inside, 0 --> before
